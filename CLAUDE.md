# Luxury Lakehouse — Engineering Standards

These standards apply to ALL code in this repository. They are non-negotiable.

## Architecture Principles

- **SOLID**: Single responsibility per module/function. Depend on abstractions.
- **Clean Code**: Meaningful names, small functions, no dead code.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Ingestion, transformation (dbt), and presentation (Streamlit) are fully isolated layers.
- **Idempotent Operations**: Every ingestion task can be re-run safely. Use partition-level overwrites, not full table drops.
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-line logs to stdout. No print statements. Include source name, row counts, and timing.

## Security Hardening

- **No secrets in code**: All authentication via Databricks runtime or environment variables. Never commit credentials, tokens, or connection strings.
- **HTTPS only**: All HTTP requests must use `https://`. Reject `http://` at the function level.
- **SSL verification**: Explicit `verify=True` on all `requests` calls. Never disable certificate verification.
- **Input validation**: Regex-validate all user-supplied identifiers (catalog, schema names) to prevent SQL injection. Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$`
- **Timeouts**: Every HTTP call must have explicit `(connect, read)` timeouts. Default: `(10, 30)`.
- **Retry with backoff**: Exponential backoff on transient errors (429, 5xx). Max 3 retries.
- **No dangerous builtins**: No `eval()`, `exec()`, `pickle.loads()`, or `subprocess.call(shell=True)`.
- **Content validation**: Verify DataFrame schema and non-empty data before every Delta write.
- **Least privilege**: Scripts write only to the specified `{catalog}.{schema}.*` — never to arbitrary paths.

## Type Safety

- **Pyright basic mode**: All Python code must pass `pyright` in basic type checking mode.
- **Pydantic models**: Use where appropriate for configuration and data contracts.
- **Type annotations**: All public function signatures must have type annotations.

## Code Quality

All code must pass these checks with zero violations:

```bash
uv run ruff check src/        # Lint (E, W, F, I, N, UP, B, S, RUF)
uv run pyright src/            # Type check (basic mode)
uv run pytest src/tests/ -v    # Unit tests
```

### Ruff Rules Enforced

| Rule Set | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| E, W     | pycodestyle errors and warnings |
| F        | pyflakes (unused imports, undefined names) |
| I        | isort (import ordering) |
| N        | PEP 8 naming conventions |
| UP       | pyupgrade (Python 3.10+ idioms) |
| B        | flake8-bugbear (common pitfalls) |
| S        | flake8-bandit (security) |
| RUF      | Ruff-specific rules |

## Project Conventions

- **Python 3.10**: Target version for all code (Databricks serverless runtime constraint).
- **Line length**: 120 characters maximum.
- **Imports**: stdlib → third-party → first-party, enforced by isort.
- **Entry points**: Each ingestion module exposes a `main()` function registered in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Delta tables**: All bronze writes include `_ingested_at` audit column with UTC timestamp.
- **Partition overwrite**: Use `replaceWhere` for incremental loads, not full table overwrites.
